OVERVIEW
--------
In this deeply personal and intellectually rich memoir, Dr. Carlos E. Cortés traces his own journey toward becoming a multiculturalist—and the continuous process of remaking that identity throughout his career. Part autobiography, part intellectual history, and part practical guide, this book offers readers insight into how one of America's leading diversity educators developed and refined his approach to multicultural education.

STRUCTURE AND CONTENT
---------------------
The book is organized around key moments and experiences that shaped Dr. Cortés's thinking:

1. Personal Origins
   - Growing up in a mixed Mexican-American and Anglo family
   - Early experiences with cultural identity and belonging
   - The influence of family narratives and community contexts

2. Academic Formation
   - Graduate studies in Latin American history
   - The transition from historian to multicultural educator
   - Intellectual influences and mentors

3. Professional Evolution
   - Developing diversity training methodologies
   - Work with corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions
   - The role of media consulting in shaping his approach

4. Ongoing Remaking
   - How new experiences and challenges required rethinking assumptions
   - The importance of intellectual humility in diversity work
   - Learning from mistakes and resistance

KEY INSIGHTS
------------
- Multiculturalism is not a destination but an ongoing journey of learning and unlearning
- Personal identity intersects with professional practice in diversity work
- Effective multicultural education requires continuous self-examination
- The "making" and "remaking" metaphor captures the dynamic nature of cultural competence

SIGNIFICANCE
------------
This work stands out in the multicultural education literature for its honest, reflexive approach. Rather than presenting multiculturalism as a set of techniques to be mastered, Dr. Cortés models the vulnerability and openness required for genuine intercultural learning. The book has been used in teacher education programs and diversity training contexts as an example of reflective practice.
