OVERVIEW

This scholarly monograph represents Dr. Carlos E. Cortés's doctoral research and his early career as a Latin American historian. The book examines the political history of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, during a tumultuous period that included the Vargas era, democratization, and the lead-up to the 1964 military coup.
