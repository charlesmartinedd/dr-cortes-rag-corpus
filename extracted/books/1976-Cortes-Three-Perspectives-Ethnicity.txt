OVERVIEW
--------
This collaborative work brings together four scholars to examine ethnic identity and experience in America through the lenses of three major minority groups: African Americans, Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and Native Americans. Published during the height of ethnic studies movements, the book represented an important effort to compare and contrast different ethnic experiences within a common analytical framework.

STRUCTURE
---------
The book is organized around three perspectives:

1. The African American Experience
   - Historical roots in slavery and segregation
   - The Civil Rights Movement and its aftermath
   - Contemporary challenges and achievements
   - Black identity and community formation

2. The Chicano Experience
   - Indigenous and Spanish colonial heritage
   - The Mexican-American War and its legacy
   - Immigration and border dynamics
   - The Chicano Movement of the 1960s-70s

3. The Native American Experience
   - Pre-contact diversity of nations
   - Colonization, removal, and reservation policies
   - Sovereignty and self-determination movements
   - Urban vs. reservation identity

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
--------------------
The book examines common themes across all three groups:
- Experiences of discrimination and marginalization
- Strategies of resistance and accommodation
- Cultural preservation and adaptation
- Political mobilization and representation
- Internal diversity within each group

HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE
-----------------------
Published in 1976—the American Bicentennial year—this work challenged dominant narratives of American identity by centering the experiences of groups often marginalized in mainstream historical accounts. It contributed to the emerging field of ethnic studies and provided a model for comparative ethnic analysis.

Dr. Cortés's contribution reflects his early career as a Latin Americanist turning toward ethnic studies and multicultural education, a transition that would define his subsequent career.

CONTEXT
-------
The mid-1970s saw:
- Growth of ethnic studies programs at universities
- Debates over multiculturalism and assimilation
- Affirmative action policies and backlash
- Continued activism for civil rights
