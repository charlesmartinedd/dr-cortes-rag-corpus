OVERVIEW
--------
In this influential work, Dr. Carlos E. Cortés examines the powerful role that mass media play in shaping children's understanding of diversity, race, ethnicity, gender, and cultural differences. Drawing on decades of research and his experience as a consultant to major media companies including Nickelodeon and DreamWorks, Cortés argues that media serve as a "curriculum" that teaches young people about the social world—often more effectively than formal schooling.

CENTRAL THESIS

- How different groups relate to each other
- What is "normal" and what is "other"
- Implicit hierarchies of value and status

IMPACT AND LEGACY
